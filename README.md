# Weather App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with OpenWeatherMap API :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain:
This project involves creating a simple weather application for the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the website.

## Current Weather Information: Users can retrieve the following data for any city:
  * Temperature (in Celsius)
  * Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy)
  * Humidity
  * Wind speed

>City Search Functionality: The app includes a search box where users can input the name of any city to get real-time weather information for that location.

## Key Technologies Used:
* HTML: For the basic structure of the web page.
* CSS: This is used to style the user interface.
* JavaScript: To fetch and display weather data dynamically.
* OpenWeatherMap API: To retrieve the weather data. A free API key from OpenWeatherMap is used to access the API.

 ## How It Works:
* Users enter a city name in the search box.
* The app requests the OpenWeatherMap API using the city name.
* The API returns the current weather data for that city.

## Implementation:
>Fetch API: The JavaScript fetch() method makes HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
>API Key: A free API key is required from OpenWeatherMap. The key is used to authenticate the API requests.
